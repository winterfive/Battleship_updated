Battleship is a grid based (2D array) game that you can play against the computer.

This is the second oop version of Battleship that I've written.  
I've rewritten it three times:   

1v: procedural    https://github.com/winterfive/Microsoft_OOP_Java/tree/master/Battleship  
2v: first oop   https://github.com/winterfive/learning_OOP_Java/tree/master/Battleship  
3v: second oop    you are here

Each time, I've applied knowledge gained from creating the previous version.
