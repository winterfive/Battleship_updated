Battleship is a simple grid based (2D array) game that you can play against the computer.

This is the second oop version of Battleship that I've written.  
I've rewritten it three times:
1v: procedural		https://github.com/winterfive/Microsoft_OOP_Java/tree/master/Battleship
2v: first oop		https://github.com/winterfive/learning_OOP_Java/tree/master/Battleship
3v: second oop  you are here

Each time, I've applied knowledge gained from creating the previous version.
