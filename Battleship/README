Battleship is a simple grid based (2D array) game that you can play against the computer.

This is the first oop version of Battleship that I've written and the first OOP app I've written ever.  
I've rewritten it three times:
1v: procedural(mostly)		https://github.com/winterfive/Microsoft_OOP_Java/tree/master/Battleship
2v: first oop	
3v: second oop    https://github.com/winterfive/learning_OOP_Java/tree/master/Battleship_updated

Each time, I've applied knowledge gained from creating the previous version.
